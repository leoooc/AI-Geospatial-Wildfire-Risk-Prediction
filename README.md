# AI-Geospatial-Wildfire-Risk-Prediction

# Introduction
Wildfires pose a severe threat to ecosystems and communities, so accurate wildfire risk prediction is critical. In this context, the task can be framed as an image segmentation problem: identifying high-risk (or already burning) areas in satellite imagery. We utilize a U-Net convolutional network, a popular encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation, as our base model​ [UW-MADISON-DATASCIENCE.GITHUB](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Toolbox/Models/UNET.html#:~:text=U,imaging%20to%20satellite%20image%20analysis). U-Net’s symmetric design with skip connections preserves spatial details from the encoder in the decoder, which is essential for precise pixel-wise classification​. To improve upon the vanilla U-Net, we incorporate enhancements such as residual connections and attention mechanisms, aiming to boost learning capacity and focus on relevant features. The approach uses the Kaggle wildfire dataset (as provided) after appropriate preprocessing, and we evaluate the model on segmentation metrics including Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient to ensure robust performance. The following sections outline the data preparation, model architecture, training process, and results, with visualizations of predicted risk maps.

# Dataset and Preprocessing
We start with the wildfire dataset, which contains satellite images of areas with and without wildfires (or risk zones) along with corresponding segmentation masks for the target regions. Before feeding the data into the model, we perform careful preprocessing:
  Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., an 80/10/10 split) to allow unbiased evaluation.
  Resizing and Formatting: Satellite images are resized to a consistent resolution suitable for U-Net (commonly 256×256 or 512×512 pixels) and converted to PyTorch tensors. The segmentation masks are also resized accordingly and mapped to binary values (0 for background, 1 for fire/risk area).
  Normalization: We normalize image pixel values to [0,1] (or standardize with mean and std) so that the model training converges faster. If using a pretrained backbone (e.g., ResNet), we would match its expected normalization.
  Data Augmentation: To increase effective data size and improve generalization, we apply random transformations. Common augmentations include horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, and random crops. For satellite imagery, we may also adjust brightness or contrast slightly. These augmentations simulate different viewing conditions and make the model more robust.

# U-Net Model Architecture

Our core model is a U-Net implemented in PyTorch. The U-Net consists of an encoder (downsampling path) and a decoder (upsampling path) with skip connections between matching levels. Each encoder stage has convolutional blocks that capture what is in the image, and each decoder stage uses transposed convolutions (or upsampling) to localize where the feature should be marked​. The skip connections concatenate encoder feature maps to the decoder, providing fine-grained spatial details that were lost during downsampling. 

# Baseline U-Net structure:
  Encoder: Four to five levels of conv blocks, each containing two 3×3 convolutions + ReLU (or another activation) and a 2×2 downsampling (MaxPool). The number of feature channels doubles at each deeper level (e.g., 64 → 128 → 256, etc.).
  Decoder: For each corresponding encoder level, an up-convolution (transpose conv) halves the number of channels and doubles spatial size, then concatenates the skip features from the encoder. This is followed by two 3×3 conv layers to refine the combined features.
  Output: A final 1×1 convolution produces the segmentation map. For binary segmentation, this yields a single-channel output (per pixel probability of fire/risk). A sigmoid activation is applied to get probabilities in [0,1]. (For multi-class segmentation, this would be multiple channels with softmax, but wildfire risk is typically a binary mask.)

# Enhancements in the Model
To boost the U-Net’s performance and learning capacity, we integrate two enhancements:
  Residual Connections: We modify the convolutional blocks to include residual links (as introduced in ResNet). In practice, each encoder and decoder block is structured as Conv → ReLU → Conv → ReLU, and we add a skip connection that feeds the block’s input to its output (after a convolutional projection if channel dimensions differ). This means the block learns a residual function on top of the identity mapping​. Residual connections help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks and improve training stability by allowing gradients to flow directly through skip paths​. We can also leverage a pretrained ResNet encoder (“Encoder-ResNet34 U-Net”) where the downsampling path is initialized from ResNet34 layers (which inherently have residual connections). Using residual blocks has been shown to improve segmentation accuracy and convergence (the model can be seen as a ResU-Net).
  Attention Mechanisms: We incorporate attention gates in the U-Net’s skip connections to help the model focus on relevant regions (e.g., actual fire or high-risk areas) and ignore background noise. Specifically, before concatenating an encoder feature map with the decoder feature, we pass the encoder features through an attention gate that uses the decoder’s context as guidance. The gate produces a mask (with values between 0 and 1) highlighting where the decoder should pay attention, and we multiply this mask with the encoder features​. This way, only the important parts of the encoder features are passed forward. Attention U-Net (as proposed by Oktay et al.) has been shown to improve sensitivity to target structures by suppressing irrelevant activations​. In our case, the attention mechanism can learn to emphasize areas with fire, smoke, or vegetation stress while down-weighting irrelevant background​. The result is an Attention U-Net that is more discerning about where to look in the imagery.
These enhancements can also be combined (yielding a Residual Attention U-Net). In implementation, we ensure the model design remains modular: e.g., a boolean flag to toggle residual blocks, and an AttentionGate layer that can be inserted into the U-Net architecture. Below is a simplified code snippet illustrating a residual conv block and an attention gate:

# Conclusion
In summary, we developed a PyTorch U-Net model enhanced with residual blocks and attention mechanisms to predict wildfire risk areas from satellite imagery. The model was trained on the Kaggle wildfire dataset with extensive preprocessing and data augmentation. It achieved strong performance, with high IoU and Dice scores indicating accurate segmentation of wildfire-affected regions. By inspecting heatmaps and overlayed predictions, we saw that the model focuses on the correct areas (e.g., active fire spots or smoke plumes), validating its effectiveness. The codebase is organized modularly, which makes it straightforward to adjust components – for example, one could swap in a different backbone (like EfficientNet) or add a Transformer-based attention module for further improvements. Future enhancements may include using multi-spectral satellite bands (beyond RGB) to provide the model with infrared signals of fire, or employing temporal sequence data (predicting fire spread across days). Nonetheless, even with the current setup, the U-Net with residual and attention improvements proves to be a powerful tool for wildfire risk prediction, aiding faster detection and response to these natural disasters.
